<!-- BRAND BRAIN

1.1 Business Profile
- Model: B2B product (mobile + web) for ODC transport operations; value delivered via workflow + reporting + route reuse.
- Revenue motion: subscription-style access (feature gating exists in product), but adoption is enterprise-style onboarding and rollout.
- Sales complexity: considered decision; multiple stakeholders (operations, survey, safety, admin). Trust cycle measured in weeks, not minutes.
- Stage: credibility-building; the platform replaces paper workflows in a safety-critical category and must prove precision.

1.2 Customer Archetype
- Who: Route Survey Lead or Operations Manager at an ODC carrier moving wind turbine components.
- Primary objection: "Will this be precise enough to trust at constraints, and will it reduce rework without adding friction?"
- Desired end-state: calm control; a feeling that every stakeholder sees the same route truth.
- Immediate bounce triggers: generic logistics language, hype-y claims, unclear workflow, or a UI that looks messy/unreliable.

1.3 Core Psychological Lever
- ROI / Efficiency, anchored in Safety: reduce re-surveys, compress report time, and prevent expensive surprises at critical points.

1.4 Industry-Appropriate Trust Signals
- Domain specificity: wind ODC, multi-week trips, truck-based route assignment, constraint-first thinking.
- Workflow integrity: immutable route geometry + versioning + lineage; exports that match what’s in the field.
- Precision cues: map-first UI, labeled states, predictable interactions, and numbers used sparingly but clearly.

1.5 Copy Tone Rules
- Short sentences. No filler.
- Lead with the operator’s problem, not the feature list.
- Second-person voice (“you”) and concrete nouns (“turn”, “clearance”, “connector”).
- No exclamation marks. Confidence stays quiet.
- Never use: revolutionize, seamless, game-changing, cutting-edge, innovate/innovative.

1.6 Animation Intensity Calibration
- Subtle: slow fades, gentle Y movement, minimal parallax. Use power1/power2 easing. No bounce.

1.7 3D Element Selection
- Abstract particle field representing GPS points and constraints; mouse-tilt max 8 degrees; slow drift to suggest precision, not spectacle.

1.8 Section Selection (conversion order)
- HERO → SOCIAL_PROOF_BAR → FEATURES → HOW_IT_WORKS → PHILOSOPHY → FAQ → FINAL_CTA → FOOTER
