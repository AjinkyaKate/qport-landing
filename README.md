# QPort Cinematic Landing Page (Vite + React)

This is a standalone landing-page app built from your business docs and the v2.0 cinematic blueprint.

## Run Locally

```bash
cd qport-landing
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- The Business Intelligence layer is embedded at the top of `index.html` as a `<!-- BRAND BRAIN -->` comment.
- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (GSAP + Three.js motion is reduced or disabled).
